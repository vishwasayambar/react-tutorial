/* Here we learn Css Module 
Why is important ?
->If we use only global compponent there is chances of getting class duplicate and also 
when complex project  it gets difficut to find css is for what component

How modle work and solved above problem?
->It create name with component with .module.css suffix then we have import it in component like
"import Itemcss from "./Item.module.css"  "  this you can take any "Itemcss" name instaed of this  "Itemcss" 

and then use className={`${Itemcss['ui-bg']}` list-item } like this but here list-item has high priority becaue it reffer as inine due to bootstrap class 
so use only like this className={`${Itemcss['ui-bg']}`} 

How class name not get conflict to other global css file classes after compile the module css classes build like
"Item_li-text-color__rp+oQ" like this means it attachend random string "__rp+oQ" suffix to each class to make it identical
therefore we use this css module classes
